Ubuntu on IBM
=============


**Ubuntu on IBM is a set of customized Ubuntu images** that allow easy access to a wide range 
of products and services - offered by both IBM cloud and Canonical. These images have an optimized
kernel that boots faster, has a smaller footprint and includes IBM-specific drivers.

**These images provide a foundation for deploying cloud-based software solutions,** specifically
for software built on Ubuntu and running on IBM cloud. They focus on providing the optimal tools 
and features needed to run specific workloads.

---------

Canonical's offerings on IBM
----------------------------

Canonical and the Ubuntu community work together with IBM to ensure that Ubuntu works seamlessly across IBM platforms, including IBM Z and LinuxONE, IBM Power Systems and the IBM Cloud.

Canonical provides optimized Ubuntu LTS images with a custom kernel, minimal size, livepatch and support.

These images are available on IBM Cloud for both the IBM VPC infrastructure and the IBM Classic infrastructure.


---------

IBM VPC vs IBM Classic infrastructures
--------------------------------------

IBM Cloud offers two types of infrastructures: IBM VPC infrastructure and IBM Classic infrastructure (Legacy). For new users, IBM only offers the VPC infrastructure. However, some long term users may still have access to the legacy Classic infrastructure. 

IBM VPC offers multiple advantages over the legacy infrastructure such as better performance, scalability, and ease of use.
